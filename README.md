## 🦠 [Covid-19 and the Impact on Malaysia Stock Market](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Covid-19-and-Impact-on-Malaysia-stock-market)

A project close to 🏡 home. I was inspired by Alex Freberg's [Data Exploration Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8H48Pj32z4GZgGWyylqv85f&index=1) on YouTube and decided to branch out on his analysis to cover the impact on my country's stock market as well.

I analysed global and local Covid-19 cases & how it has impacted the stock market index prices from Jan 2020 to July 2021 using SQL and Tableau.

Analysis on vehicles’ fuel economy in 2008 and 2018 to understand usage of alternative sources of fuel, changes in greenhouse gas and smog ratings over the decade, and vehicle features associated with better fuel economy. _(It's more interesting than the summary sounds, I promise!)_

In this time-series analysis, I use moving average method to analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.
