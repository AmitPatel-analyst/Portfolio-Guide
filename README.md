## SQL Projects

### 🥑 [8 Week SQL Challenge](https://github.com/katiehuangx/8-Week-SQL-Challenge)

**Overview** 

It's a 8-week SQL challenges with individual case studies and questions. 

**Thoughts** 

It's a a fun way to learn SQL and practice questions without having to create your own metrics or case study questions -  this is especially helpful when you're new in data analytics and may find it daunting to start a case study on your own! Bonus points - the topics usually revolve around food! 😉

Let me tell you, the questions are very challenging and that's why it's fun! I've learnt more on SQL from these questions more than any courses or tutorials I've taken! JOINs and CTEs are a staple in most of the questions. 

### 🦠 [Covid-19 and the Impact on Malaysia Stock Market](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Covid-19-and-Impact-on-Malaysia-stock-market)

**Overview** 

This ia a project close to 🏡 home. It's an analysis of global and local Covid-19 cases & how it has impacted KLCI index prices over the past 1.5 year. I used MS SQL Server and Tableau.

**Thoughts** 

This was my 1st project using SQL and Tableau. It's a [data exploration project by Alex Freberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8H48Pj32z4GZgGWyylqv85f&index=1).
