## SQL Projects

### 🥑 [8 Week SQL Challenge](https://github.com/katiehuangx/8-Week-SQL-Challenge)

This is a 8-week SQL challenges with 8 individual case studies that comes with its own story, data set and a bunch of interesting questions. It was created by [Danny Ma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/datawithdanny/) as a SQL learning journey. Click [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com) for the website.

Anyone who knows me know that I'm a BIG FAN of the #8WeekSQLChallenge! This is where I learnt and improved my SQL skills the most. 

It's a a fun way to learn SQL and practice on questions without having to create your own metrics or questions -  this is especially helpful when you're new in data analytics and may find it daunting to start a case study on your own! Bonus points - the topics usually revolve around food! 😉

Let me tell you, the questions are very challenging and that's why it's fun! I've learnt more on SQL from these questions more than any courses or tutorials I've taken! JOINs and CTEs are a staple in most of the questions. 

### 🦠 [Covid-19 and the Impact on Malaysia Stock Market](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Covid-19-and-Impact-on-Malaysia-stock-market)

This ia a project close to 🏡 home. I was inspired by Alex Freberg's [Data Exploration Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8H48Pj32z4GZgGWyylqv85f&index=1) on YouTube and decided to branch out on his analysis to cover the impact on my country's stock market as well.

It's an analysis of global and local Covid-19 cases & how it has impacted the stock market index prices from Jan 2002 to July 2021. The tools I use are SQL Server and Tableau.
