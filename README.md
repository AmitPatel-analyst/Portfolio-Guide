**Skills Learnt:** Aggregations, Joins, CTEs, Window functions (aggregates, ranking, running total, partitioned averages), CASE WHEN statements, subqueries, nested subqueries, DATETIME functions, data type conversion, text and string manipulation

## üë©üèª‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è [Health Analytics Mini Case Study](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Serious-SQL-Apprenticeship/blob/main/Health%20Analytics%20Mini%20Case%20Study.md)

**Skills Learnt:** 
- Create temporary tables.
- Aggregations, Joins, CTEs, Window functions (summary statistics: mode, median)

## üé¨ [Marketing Analytics Case Study](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Serious-SQL-Apprenticeship/blob/main/Marketing%20Analytics%20Case%20Study.md) 
_[Ongoing]_

## ü¶† [Covid-19 and the Impact on Malaysia Stock Market](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Covid-19-and-Impact-on-Malaysia-stock-market)

A project close to üè° home. I was inspired by Alex Freberg's [Data Exploration Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8H48Pj32z4GZgGWyylqv85f&index=1) on YouTube and decided to branch out on his analysis to cover the impact on my country's stock market as well.

I analysed global and local Covid-19 cases & how it has impacted the stock market index prices from Jan 2020 to July 2021 using SQL and Tableau.

# Python Projects

## ‚õΩÔ∏è [TMDb Movie Analysis](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/main/Part%202:%20Intro%20to%20Data%20Analysis/Project:%20TMDb%20Movie%20Analysis/TMDB%20Movie%20Analysis.ipynb)

An analysis of TMDb movie data to understand the relationship between budget and revenue, find out the most popular genres, and which actor acted in highest revenue movies.

**Key Learning:**
- Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib
- Explored and cleaned data by handling missing values and duplications.
- Split multiple values and explode them into individual rows.
- Visualized data using histograms, scatter plots and bar plots.
- Draw conclusions by asking questions such as
  - **Which genres are associated with high popularity?**
  - **Which actor is associated with higher popularity and revenue profit??**

## ‚õΩÔ∏è [Analysing Fuel Economy](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/main/Part%202:%20Intro%20to%20Data%20Analysis/Case%20Study%20%232:%20Fuel%20Economy/Fuel_Economy.ipynb)

Analysis on vehicles‚Äô fuel economy in 2008 and 2018 to find usage of alternative sources of fuel, changes in SmartWay Certification characteristics over the decade, and vehicle features associated with better fuel economy.

**Key Learning:**
- Explored data using `.head()`, `.describe()` and cleaned data by handling missing values and duplications
- Corrected inconsistent data types by converting from `string` to `float`, `float` to `int` and many more
- Visualized data using histograms, scatter plots and box plots
- Draw conclusions by asking questions such as
  - **What are the characteristics of SmartWay vehicles? Have they improved over time?**
  - **For all the models that were produced in 2008 that are still produced in 2018, how much has the mpg (miles/gallon) improved and which vehicle improved the most?**

## üç∑ [Wine Quality](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/main/Part%202:%20Intro%20to%20Data%20Analysis/Case%20Study%20%231:%20Wine%20Quality/Wine_Quality.ipynb)

A study on red and white wine samples and understanding whether certain types of wine and their qualities (alcohol level, sugar content and acidity level) are associated with higher wine quality.

**Key Learning:**
- Assessed and transformed data using `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.shape`, `.rename()` and more!
- Visualized data using histograms and scatter plots
- Draw conclusions by asking questions such as
  - **Do wines with higher alcoholic content receive better ratings?**
  - **Do sweeter wines (more residual sugar) receive better ratings?**

## üå§ [Explore Weather Trends](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/main/Part%201:%20Welcome/Project%20%231:%20Explore%20Weather%20Trends/Project%201%20-%20Explore%20Weather%20Trends.ipynb)

In this project, I analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.

**Key Learning:**
- Time Series Analysis using 10-Years Moving Average
- Extract data using SQL joins
- Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Data Cleaning - Handling and dropping missing values and duplication
- Visualization using line chart and Correlation Coefficient using heatmap

## üõç [Super Store Analysis](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Super-Store-Analysis/blob/main/Super_Store_Analysis.ipynb)

Analysis of sales data to find out highest revenue and profit product categories and top customer segments.

## üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è [Bellabeat Fitness Tracking Analysis](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone/blob/main/bellabeat-data-analysis.ipynb)

This is a special project for me as it is my ‚ú®first‚ú® foray into data analytics. 

Discovered insights into whether users are using the FitBit app for tracking health habits, their frequency of usage across the week and whether there is correlation between the hours logged, number of steps taken and calories burnt

## üå± [DataCamp Projects](https://github.com/katiehuangx/DataCamp-Projects)

A series of guided and unguided projects developed by DataCamp.
