**Skills Learnt:** Aggregations, Joins, CTEs, Window functions (aggregates, ranking, running total, partitioned averages), CASE WHEN statements, subqueries, nested subqueries, DATETIME functions, data type conversion, text and string manipulation

## 👩🏻‍⚕️ [Health Analytics Mini Case Study](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Serious-SQL-Apprenticeship/blob/main/Health%20Analytics%20Mini%20Case%20Study.md)

**Skills Learnt:** 
- Create temporary tables.
- Aggregations, Joins, CTEs, Window functions (summary statistics: mode, median)

## 🎬 [Marketing Analytics Case Study](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Serious-SQL-Apprenticeship/blob/main/Marketing%20Analytics%20Case%20Study.md) 
_[Ongoing]_

### 🦠 [Covid-19 and the Impact on Malaysia Stock Market](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Covid-19-and-Impact-on-Malaysia-stock-market)

A project close to 🏡 home. I was inspired by Alex Freberg's [Data Exploration Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8H48Pj32z4GZgGWyylqv85f&index=1) on YouTube and decided to branch out on his analysis to cover the impact on my country's stock market as well.

I analysed global and local Covid-19 cases & how it has impacted the stock market index prices from Jan 2020 to July 2021 using SQL and Tableau.

## Python Projects

### ⛽️ [Analysing Fuel Economy](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/main/Part%202:%20Intro%20to%20Data%20Analysis/Case%20Study%20%232:%20Fuel%20Economy/Fuel_Economy.ipynb)

**Key Learning:**
- Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib
- Assessed and transformed data using `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.shape`, `.rename()` and more!
- Visualized data using histograms and scatter plots
- Draw conclusions by asking questions such as
  - **Do wines with higher alcoholic content receive better ratings?**
  - **Do sweeter wines (more residual sugar) receive better ratings?**


### 🍷 [Wine Quality](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/main/Part%202:%20Intro%20to%20Data%20Analysis/Case%20Study%20%231:%20Wine%20Quality/Wine_Quality.ipynb)

I analysed red and white wine samples with its associated wine qualities from north of Portugal.

**Key Learning:**
- Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib
- Assessed and transformed data using `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.shape`, `.rename()` and more!
- Visualized data using histograms and scatter plots
