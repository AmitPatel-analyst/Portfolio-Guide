# SQL Projects

## 🥑 [8 Week SQL Challenge](https://github.com/katiehuangx/8-Week-SQL-Challenge)

A series of SQL case studies where I perform Data Cleaning and Data Transformation and solve Business Questions using SQL.

- [#2 Pizza Runner](https://github.com/katiehuangx/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/blob/main/Case%20Study%20%232%20-%20Pizza%20Runner/Data%20Cleaning%20and%20Transformation.md)
- [#3 Foodie-Fi](https://github.com/katiehuangx/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/blob/main/Case%20Study%20%233%20-%20Foodie-Fi/A.%20Customer%20Journey.md)
- [#4 Data Bank](https://github.com/katiehuangx/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/blob/main/Case%20Study%20%234%20-%20Data%20Bank/A.%20Customer%20Nodes%20Exploration.md)
- [#5 Data Mart](https://github.com/katiehuangx/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/blob/main/Case%20Study%20%235%20-%20Data%20Mart/A.%20Data%20Cleansing%20Steps.md)

**Skills Learnt:** Aggregations, Joins, CTEs, Window functions (aggregates, ranking, running total, partitioned averages), CASE WHEN statements, subqueries, nested subqueries, DATETIME functions, data type conversion, text and string manipulation

## 👩🏻‍⚕️ [Health Analytics Mini Case Study](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Serious-SQL-Apprenticeship/blob/main/Health%20Analytics%20Mini%20Case%20Study.md)

**Skills Learnt:** 
- Create temporary tables.
- Aggregations, Joins, CTEs, Window functions (summary statistics: mode, median)

## 🎬 [Marketing Analytics Case Study](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Serious-SQL-Apprenticeship/blob/main/Marketing%20Analytics%20Case%20Study.md) 
_[Ongoing]_

## 🦠 [Covid-19 and the Impact on Malaysia Stock Market](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Covid-19-and-Impact-on-Malaysia-stock-market)

A project close to 🏡 home. I was inspired by Alex Freberg's [Data Exploration Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8H48Pj32z4GZgGWyylqv85f&index=1) on YouTube and decided to branch out on his analysis to cover the impact on my country's stock market as well.

I analysed global and local Covid-19 cases & how it has impacted the stock market index prices from Jan 2020 to July 2021 using SQL and Tableau.

# Python Projects

## ⛽️ [Analysing Fuel Economy](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/main/Part%202:%20Intro%20to%20Data%20Analysis/Case%20Study%20%232:%20Fuel%20Economy/Fuel_Economy.ipynb)

An analysis of fuel economy data based on a series of tests conducted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.

**Key Learning:**
- Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib
- Explored data using `.head()`, `.describe()` and more!
- Cleaned data by handling missing values and duplications
- Corrected inconsistent data types by converting from `string` to `float`, `float` to `int` and many more
- Visualized data using histograms, scatter plots and box plots
- Draw conclusions by asking questions such as
  - **What are the characteristics of SmartWay vehicles? Have they improved over time?**
  - **For all the models that were produced in 2008 that are still produced in 2018, how much has the mpg (miles/gallon) improved and which vehicle improved the most?**

## 🍷 [Wine Quality](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/main/Part%202:%20Intro%20to%20Data%20Analysis/Case%20Study%20%231:%20Wine%20Quality/Wine_Quality.ipynb)

I analysed red and white wine samples with its associated wine qualities from north of Portugal.

**Key Learning:**
- Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib
- Assessed and transformed data using `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.shape`, `.rename()` and more!
- Visualized data using histograms and scatter plots
- Draw conclusions by asking questions such as
  - **Do wines with higher alcoholic content receive better ratings?**
  - **Do sweeter wines (more residual sugar) receive better ratings?**

## 🌤 [Explore Weather Trends](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/main/Part%201:%20Welcome/Project%20%231:%20Explore%20Weather%20Trends/Project%201%20-%20Explore%20Weather%20Trends.ipynb)

In this project, I analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.

**Key Learning:**
- Time Series Analysis using 10-Years Moving Average
- Extract data using SQL joins
- Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Data Cleaning - Handling and dropping missing values and duplication
- Visualization using line chart and Correlation Coefficient using heatmap

## 🛍 [Super Store Analysis](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Super-Store-Analysis/blob/main/Super_Store_Analysis.ipynb)

I analysed sales data of a fictitious retail store and provided my insights and recommendations to the business owners.

## 🏃🏻‍♀️ [Bellabeat Fitness Tracking Analysis](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone/blob/main/bellabeat-data-analysis.ipynb)

This is a special project for me as it is my ✨first✨ foray into data analytics. 

In this analysis, I analysed FitBit's Fitness tracking app data to gain insights into how consumers are using the FitBit app and discover trends and insights for Bellabeat marketing strategy.

## 🌱 [DataCamp Projects](https://github.com/katiehuangx/DataCamp-Projects)

A series of guided and unguided projects developed by DataCamp.
